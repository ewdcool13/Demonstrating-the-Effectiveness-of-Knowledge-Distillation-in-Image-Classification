# Demonstrating-the-Effectiveness-of-Knowledge-Distillation-in-Image-Classification
PyTorch code for CIFAR-100 that trains a ResNet-50 teacher, generates soft labels, builds depth-reduced ResNet students and a MobileNetV2 student, and applies knowledge distillation with α-weighted hard/soft labels while logging accuracy and training time.
